# recipes-react-native
React Native app for Recipes

I've been playing with Recipe data, scraping, ETL, etc.
This app uses that Recipe data, purpose TBD. 

## Initial Setup
```
npm install -g expo-cli
npx create-expo-app RecipesApp
```

### Run Simulator
```
npm start ios
```

### Run on device
First install [https://expo.dev/go]("Expo Go") app on your device.

Then run on the same same network phone is connected to. 
You can scan the QR code to connect if it doesn't show up in the Expo Go menu.
```
npx expo start
```
